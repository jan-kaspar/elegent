* problem with low |t| sampling: visible in B(t)
 - then finish the TODO in "code.asy"

-------------------- long term --------------------

* use of autotools system
 - redesign structure of source files, scripts, ...
	- implications on the interface to CMSSW
    - need to have two src subdirectories (library and utilities) ??
 - which files go to release tar balls?
 - which files go to installation (and where)? In particular what to do with scripts?
 - targets: shared library and executables (linked againts the library)
 - search for dependencies (ROOT and HepMC): in the order: input by user (if entered via a switch), $ROOTSYS, /usr
 - for ROOT: there are 3 subdirs of relevance: /bin(/root-config), /lib(/libCore.so), /include(/TObject.h)
 - for HepMC: there are 2 subdirs of relevance: /lib(/libHepMC), /include/HepMC(/GenEvent.h)
 - finaly update: README, web, Wiki

* rename ElegentTest to ElegentGeneratorTest ?

* middle range t-plots: linear, up to ~1.5 GeV^2

* traceable Elegent version - a la Asymptote? 
 - in ROOT files, in plots
 - release or SVN revision

* add more models
 - group of Ferreira contacted, waiting for response

* s-distributions: add si_el(s), si_inel(s) and their ratios

* experimental data to plots

* Jenkovszky model: other trajectory parameterisations than Eq. (8)?

* Islam model: implement updates (multiple omega exchange, new sign for LxG amplitude)

* custom integration --> some standard library (e.g. GSL)
