* BH model - problem with N_g

* BSW model
 - problem with complex logarithm
 - factor in front of the regeon term
 - energy dependence S0 does actually depend on t.

* model problems to Wiki

* finish Wiki

* README file giving
 - the names and a brief description of all the files that make up the package
 - clear instructions on the installation and execution of the program

* problem with low |t| sampling: visible in B(t)

* s-distributions: issue with BSW module

* s-distributions to test module

* list models to test module

* update make_release

* update TOTEM TWiki, cfg files (new label scheme, how to get available model list)

* check compatibility with old curves

* add more energies (generate dists and plots, mention ISR, SppS, RHIC, Tevetra in the text)
 - pp: ISR (23, 31, 53), RHIC (200)
 - app: ISR (31, 53), SppS (546, 630), Tevatron (1800)

* plots: grid in Asymptote

-------------------- long term --------------------

* add more models (e.g. Brazilian group)?

* Jenkovszky model: other trajectory parameterisations than Eq. (8)?

* custom integration --> some standard library (like GSL ?)

* use of GNU automake system
