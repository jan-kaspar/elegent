* use of CMake system
 - redesign structure of source files, scripts, ...
	- implications on the interface to CMSSW
 - which files go to release tar balls?
 - which files go to installation (and where)? In particular what to do with scripts?
 - integrate tests
 - version(s) to some config file - traceable Elegent version - a la Asymptote?
 	- in ROOT files, in plots
 	- release or SVN revision
 - finaly update: README, web, Wiki
 - test on: pckasparek, lxplus, hepforge

* problem with low |t| sampling: visible in B(t)
 - then finish the TODO in "code.asy"

* middle range t-plots: linear, up to ~1.5 GeV^2

-------------------- long term --------------------

* add more models
 - group of Ferreira contacted, waiting for response

* s-distributions: add si_el(s), si_inel(s) and their ratios

* experimental data to plots

* Jenkovszky model: other trajectory parameterisations than Eq. (8)?

* Islam model: implement updates (multiple omega exchange, new sign for LxG amplitude)

* custom integration --> some standard library (e.g. GSL)
