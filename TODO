* BH model - problem with N_g

* BSW model
 - problem with complex logarithm
 - factor in front of the regeon term
 - energy dependence S0 does actually depend on t.

* references in model headers: synchronise with Wiki

* README file giving
 - the names and a brief description of all the files that make up the package
 - clear instructions on the installation and execution of the program

* problem with low |t| sampling: visible in B(t)

* s-distributions

* new label system


-------------------- long term --------------------

* add more models (e.g. Brazilian group)?

* Jenkovszky model: other trajectory parameterisations than Eq. (8)?

* custom integration --> some standard library (like GSL ?)

* use of GNU automake system
